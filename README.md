# CJMCU_ATMEGA32U4_BADUSB
The CJMCU clones of the RubberDucky are no different when it comes to be used by pentesters but it surely has a different circuit mesh to get around as a new user of this device; There are many ways to flash the firmware or inject payloads when it comes to rubber duckies and badusbs but unfortunately you'll end up wasting your time downloading numerous exploits and firmware flash tools and to no help give in this repo i will be showing how to upload a rubber ducky script along with the arduino code to make it work.
